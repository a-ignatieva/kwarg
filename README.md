# Installation

This repository contains the program KwARG, and two small programs for data manipulation called "simplify" and "flip". 

A copy of Beagle is also provided, which computes exactly the minimum number of crossover recombinations required for a dataset under the infinite sites assumption (Lyngs√∏, R., Song, Y.S., and Hein, J. (2005). Minimum Recombination Histories by Branch and Bound. Proceedings of WABI 2005, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3692, pp. 239-250).

## Binaries
Binaries are available for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. 

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/a-ignatieva/kwarg/releases) for your OS and unzip. The resulting folder will contain the binaries for KwARG, simplify, flip and Beagle, as well as example input files and a tutorial explaining usage.

The programs are run via command line: through Terminal on Mac OS or Linux, or via Command Prompt on Windows. Navigate to the appropriate folder, using for example
```sh
cd Downloads/binaries_mac
```

Try the following to check if everything works correctly:
```sh
./kwarg < kreitman_snp.txt
```
on Linux and Mac OS, or
```sh
kwarg < kreitman_snp.txt
```
on Windows.

Option descriptions can be printed by running "./kwarg -h" or "kwarg -h".


## Compile from source

Clone the repository using git via command line:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/a-ignatieva/kwarg.git
```
or download the source code for the [latest release](https://github.com/a-ignatieva/kwarg/releases) and unzip.

Then follow the OS-specific instructions below to compile. Examples and usage instructions are provided in the "binaries_X" folders.

### Linux and Mac OS

Open Terminal and navigate to the "source" folder, for instance:
```sh
cd Downloads/kwarg-1.0/source
```

The following command will compile KwARG, Beagle, simplify and flip:
```sh
make all
```

The following command will delete the compiled objects:
```sh
make clean
```

### Windows

Rename "Makefile_windows" to "Makefile", and "generatebitfunctions_windows.py" to "generatebitfunctions.py" (overwriting the existing files).

Install a gcc compiler if you do not have this; for example, download WinLibs (http://winlibs.com/) to get MinGW-w64, and follow the installation instructions to set this up.
Add the mingw64/bin directory to PATH. 

You will also need python; the Makefile presumes you invoke python with the "py" command. 

Open Command Prompt from the Start menu, and navigate to the "source" folder, for instance:
```sh
cd Downloads/kwarg-1.0/source
```

Compile using 
```sh
mingw32-make all
```
